Guidelines
==========

- Lua scripts should be separated on a per hero basis

- Use as many AbilitySpecials as possible, ***do not hardcode the lua file.***

- Every ability should be portable (i.e. 0 dependence on each other).
  - If the ability depends on another ability to function (Earth Spirit, Invoker, SF Requiem, etc) leave it for later.

- Don't Use Global Lua Events (related to making the spells portable). Abilities should work without any main addon scripts.

- Dont bother with Cast Animation, Aghs Upgrades or completely dota-hardcoded interactions

- Keep it as much datadriven as possible (for example don't lua FindUnitsInRadius if you only need to do aoe damage, use ActOnTargets Damage instead)

- Use default particles and sounds

- If you find an ability that seems hard or impossible to rewrite, ask and document your attempts, others will help you

- Follow this coding style:

For Datadriven KeyValues
~~~
"OnSpellStart"
{
    "RunScript"
    {
        "ScriptFile"    "heroes/hero_name/ability_name.lua"
        "Function"      "AbilityName"
    }
}
~~~

For Lua functions
~~~
--[[

]]
function AbilityName( event )
    -- Variables
    local caster = event.caster
    local ability = event.ability
    local value = = ability:GetLevelSpecialValueFor( "value" , ability:GetLevel() - 1  )

    -- Try to comment each block of logical actions
    -- If the ability handle is not nil, print a message
    if ability then
        print("RunScript")
    end
end
~~~

- Modifier Name conventions (very important for automating tooltips later)

  - Start with "modifier_"
  - Then add the spell name (no hero name)
  - Add "_buff" "_debuff" "_stun" or anything when appropiate
